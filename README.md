"After seeing a Twitter post from @localhost_4173, I decided to try using Claude and DeepSeek to create a cute and functional to-do app. I used to do some front-end work several years ago, but I haven’t done it in a long time. I worked on it for two days, and I believe that with more foundational knowledge, I could complete it more efficiently

After adding more and more functions, I realized I needed to quickly brush up on my front-end skills.
